# CS 300 â€“ Data Structures and Algorithms Portfolio Artifact

## ðŸ§© Overview
This repository includes two key artifacts from **CS 300: Data Structures and Algorithms**.

- **Project One:** Runtime and memory analysis of different data structures, including pseudocode for the Vector, Hash Table, and Binary Search Tree implementations.  
- **Project Two:** A working C++ program that loads, sorts, and prints Computer Science course data using a Binary Search Tree (BST).

Together, these projects demonstrate my understanding of **data structures, algorithms, and software design efficiency**.

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In Project One, I analyzed the runtime and memory usage of different data structures to determine which would be most efficient for storing and searching course information. In Project Two, I implemented a program that loads course data, organizes it with a data structure, and prints the list of courses in alphanumeric order. These projects focused on applying data structures and algorithms to create efficient, real-world software solutions.

### How did you approach the problem?
I compared several data structuresâ€”**vectors**, **hash tables**, and **binary search trees (BSTs)**â€”to find the best balance between efficiency and simplicity. Understanding the behavior of each structure helped me select one that optimized both speed and memory usage. Data structures are essential because they determine how effectively programs can access, store, and manipulate data.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks?
When I ran into logic or memory issues, I used step-by-step debugging and printed test outputs to trace the problem. Reviewing pseudocode, diagrams, and algorithm flow helped me pinpoint errors and confirm that my data traversal and sorting functions were working as intended.

### How has this project expanded your approach to designing software?
These projects taught me to plan before codingâ€”thinking about data organization, expected input size, and performance constraints early on. I now design software with both **efficiency** and **scalability** in mind, evaluating algorithmic complexity (Big O notation) before implementation.

### How has this project evolved your programming style?
I now focus on writing **maintainable, readable, and adaptable code**. I use clear naming conventions, modular functions, and concise comments to explain logic. Iâ€™ve also become comfortable using **GitHub for version control**, which ensures my work is organized, trackable, and ready for future collaboration or portfolio review.
