# Data Structures and Algorithms – C++

This repository contains C++ projects focused on implementing and analyzing fundamental data structures and algorithms.

The work emphasizes problem-solving, runtime efficiency, and clean code organization using core computer science principles.

## Project Overview
The projects in this repository explore common data structures through practical programming assignments. Emphasis was placed on correctness, performance, and maintainability.

### Included Projects
- Runtime and memory analysis of data structures, including vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees
- A C++ course planner application that loads, sorts, and displays data using a Binary Search Tree (BST)

## Key Concepts and Skills
- C++ programming fundamentals
- Data structures:
  - Vectors
  - Hash tables
  - Binary search trees (BST)
- Algorithm analysis and runtime complexity (Big-O)
- Searching and sorting techniques
- File input/output and data parsing

## Approach
Each project focused on:
- Choosing appropriate data structures for the problem
- Evaluating time and space complexity
- Writing readable and maintainable C++ code
- Testing functionality and performance

## What I Learned
- How different data structures impact performance
- How to analyze and compare algorithm efficiency
- How to design programs around data access patterns

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Algorithm analysis and design principles

This repository reflects my understanding of core computer science fundamentals and my ability to apply them in practical scenarios.
